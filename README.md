This repository contains various molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of **biological molecules** using **NAMD** and **VMD**. The aim of this project is to study the structural dynamics and interactions of biological macromolecules in different environments.

---

## **Key Components**:
- **Molecular Dynamics Simulations**: Utilizing NAMD for performing simulations of various biological systems.
  
- **Visualization**: Using VMD to analyze and visualize simulation trajectories and molecular structures.

- **Analysis Tools**: Implementing tools to assess stability, interactions, and other critical parameters of biological molecules.

---

## **Methodology**:

### **1. System Preparation**:
- Retrieve biological structures from the **Protein Data Bank** (PDB).
  
- Prepare systems by solvation in appropriate solvents (e.g., water) and ion neutralization.
  
- Generate necessary input files using **CHARMM-GUI** or other software.

### **2. Simulation**:
- Conduct equilibration and production phases using **NAMD**.
  
- Perform analyses such as RMSD, hydrogen bonds, and other relevant measurements.

### **3. Visualization**:
- Use **VMD** to visualize MD trajectories, generate images, and create movies to present findings.

---

## **Results**:
- The results of this project will be documented in individual simulations and analyses, showcasing insights into the structural dynamics of biological molecules.
